# Context

This example tests an external potential called MWPotential2014. This potential is a reference to model Milky-Way-like galaxies. It is based on galpy's `MWPotential2014`. The parameters can be found in galpy's paper, p.7:
galpy: A Python Library for Galactic Dynamics, Jo Bovy (2015), Astrophys. J. Supp., 216, 29 (<arXiv/1412.3451>)

# How to run this example

In a terminal at the root of the "swiftsim" directory, type:

`./autogen.sh`

Then, configure swift to take into account external potentials. Type:

`./configure --with-ext-potential=nfw-mn-psc`

Feel free to adapt other configurations parameters depending on your system. Then, build the code by typing:

`make`

Finally, to run this example, open a terminal in the present directory and type:

`./run.sh`
